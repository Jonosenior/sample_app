## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book).

## Chapter 3

  * The rails script generates a new controller with $ rails generate controller ControllerName <optional action names>.

  * New routes are defined in the file config/routes.rb.

  * Testing - use 'assert_select' to test presence of an html tag.

  * ERB - use <% provide(:title, "Contact") %> to set a label and pass a string, and then yield(:title) to inset that label.
